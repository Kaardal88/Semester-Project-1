# Community Science Museum

This is my first semester project. In this assignment we should make an engaging website for CSM. The target group for this project is children from ages 7-15 and their families.<br>
I used my new skills in HTML and CSS. I also implemented my drawing talent. So I designed and drew the logo and the icons.<br>
We also needed to work within the WCAG guidelines, SEO best practise and content strategy.
