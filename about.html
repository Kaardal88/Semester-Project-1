                        COMMUNITY SCIENCE MUSEUM
                    </h2>
                    <p>Over the course of human history, science has developed from our early
                        understanding of fire, wind, water, and earth to exploring everything from galaxies far away
                        to
                        the very building blocks of life itself.
                        The aim of our museum is to create a space where everyone can experience the wonders of our
                        discoveries and perhaps even ignite a lifelong passion to continue the exploration of the
                        world
                        around us.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        We believe science should not be confined to the textbook, but brought to live through
                        exhibits.
                        This is why we have over 1000 different exhibits on the many varied subjects of science to
                        explore. Many of these exhibits are designed for you to interact with and play around to see
                        science come to life (apart from the dinosaur exhibits – they only come to life at night
                        when
                        everyone’s gone home)

                    <p>Are you a young person looking to learn more about science? Come on down to
                        our museum, there’s plenty to see and do.
                        You can learn about Newtonian physics from our bumper swing, or why not travel back in time
                        and meet our resident Woolly Mammoth? Our exhibits are designed to be accessible for
                        interested minds, so make sure you come ready to learn and explore.

                        We also have the Young Stars club which meets once a week on a Saturday between 10:00 and
                        13:00 where you’ll get to explore and experiment with our team of experts.
                        During the school holidays we run special holiday clubs where you can join other children
                        your age to go on a journey of discovery. Each holiday we pick a new theme to explore. To
                        find out more about the holiday club and how you can join, send us a message.

                    <p>As a community-driven museum, we want to work with schools to create places
                        of learning and exploring. Our team are on hand to give your students guided tours of the
                        museum, teach them in our learning laboratory, and provide great video presentations that
                        will excite and inspire them.
